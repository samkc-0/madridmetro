- Select a train to follow.
- Toggle visibility of a given metro line.
- Utilize shaders for performance.
- Handle clear rendering of multiple metro lines sharing the same two stations.
- Station size & color based on the number of metro lines connected.
- More metro lines after Line 12 (R, Metro Ligero).
